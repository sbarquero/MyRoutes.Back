## Management with Docker

### Create Docker Image

To create the Docker image, the following command has been used:

```
docker build -t sbarquero/myroutes.back:1.1.8 .
docker build -t sbarquero/myroutes.back:latest .
```

### Upload image to repository

To upload the image to Docker, the following command was used:

```
docker push sbarquero/myroutes.back:1.1.8
docker push sbarquero/myroutes.back:latest
```

### Implementation of the backend in Docker containers

By running the following command, the containers needed to get the backend up and running are raised.

The containers created are:
  - `mongodb` - MongoDB server (Port 27018)
  - `mongo-express` - Mongo Express client (Port 8081)
  - `myroutes.back` - MyRoutes backend with NodeJS (Port 3000)

```
docker-compose up
```
